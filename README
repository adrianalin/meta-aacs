AACS image
==========

In order to build the aacs-image (only for Raspberry Pi4 - has USB OTG controller):
* bitbake aacs-image
* flash the generated image build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64/aacs-image-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bz2: sudo bmaptool copy --nobmap aacs-image-raspberrypi4-64.wic.bz2 /dev/sdX (replace X with SD card device letter)
* run openauto on laptop:
	- git://github.com/opencardev/aasdk.git branch=development
	- git://github.com/matt2005/openauto.git branch=yocto
* Raspberry Pi4 connects to laptop via USB C cable which is both power and data.
* Run openauto on laptop (acts as the head unit of the car).
* On Raspberry Pi4 (acts as the android mobile end):
	# cd /home/root
	* start `AAServer`; acts as the android mobile; you should see the video pattern showing up on laptop
	# AAServer &
	* start `GetEvents`; communicates with the `AAServer` (via named socket `socket`), opens a new communication channel to receive `touch` events from the head unit and forwards them to existing window called `Terminal` (check the logs)
	# GetEvents socket Terminal
	# start `AAClient socket` where socket is the socket name that `AAServer opened`. Don't forget to conect your Android phone via USB to device.
